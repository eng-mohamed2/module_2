            Somaliland lies in northwestern Somalia, on the southern 
            coast of the Gulf of Aden. It is bordered by the remainder
             of Somalia (per international recognition) to the east,
              Djibouti to the northwest, and Ethiopia to the south and
               west.[14] Its claimed territory has an area of 176,120
                square kilometres (68,000 sq mi),[6] with approximately 
                4 million residents. The capital and the largest city is Hargeisa,
             with a population of around 1,500,000 residents.[15]
In 1988, the Siad Barre government began a crackdown against the 
Hargeisa-based Somali National Movement (SNM) and other
 militant groups, which were among the events that led
  to the Somali Civil War.[16] The conflict left the 
  country's economic and military infrastructure severely 
  damaged. Following the collapse of Barre's government in
   early 1991, local authorities, led by the SNM, 
   unilaterally declared independence from Somalia on
    18 May of the same year and reinstated the borders
     of the former short-lived independent State of Somaliland.[17][18]

            Since then, the territory has been governed by democratically 
            elected governments that seek international recognition as the
             Government of the Republic of Somaliland (Somali: Dowlada Jam
             huuriyadda Somaliland, Arabic: جمهورية صوماليلاند‎ Dawlat J
             umhūrīyat Ṣūmālīlānd).[19][20][21][22] The central gove
             rnment maintains informal ties with some foreign governme
             nts, who have sent delegations to Hargeisa.[17][23][24] Et
             hiopia also maintains a trade office in the region.[25] 
             However, Somaliland's self-proclaimed independence is not
              officially been recognised by any country or internation
              al organisation.[17][26][27] It is a member of the Unrepr
              esented Nations and Peoples Organization, an advocacy g
              roup whose members consist of indigenous peoples, minor
              ities and unrecognised or occupied territories.[28]
